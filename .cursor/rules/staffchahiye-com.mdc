description: rules to build the tech first platform model website for staffchahiye.com
i want to build a website with the same design aesthetics as employer.apna.co. we'll start with each section & I'll give you website images explaining some of custom edits & gradually build sections & pages. i want the color scheme to be black+white+orange with the company name to be: "StaffChahiye".
for each step or iteration of implementation, you'll be writing an extremely comprehensive plan of action ranging from the name & types of files to be created for a feature and why, the functions & variables in those files & how do they link or contribute to making of the overall site and iteratively append it in [plan.md](mdc:plan.md) in markdown. Be very strict of high quality code standards as in follow the DRY (do not repeat yourself) principle, STRICTLY ALWAYS THINK OF writing less code and not more while solving a problem.
